## 100 Days of Code Challenge

## 🎯 Purpose
This repository documents my journey through the #100DaysOfCode challenge, where I commit to coding daily. The goal is to maintain consistent practice while exploring various technologies, languages, and concepts. Each day represents a new learning opportunity, whether it's a complex project or a simple script.

## 🚀 Focus Areas
- Systems Programming (Rust, C)
- Web Assembly (Rust + WASM)
- Low-level Programming (Assembly)
- Cross-platform Mobile Development (Flutter/Dart)
- Various other languages and technologies as exploration opportunities

## 💡 Project Structure
Each day's work is organized in its own directory:
```
/day_001
/day_002
...
/day_100
```

Each directory contains:
- Source code
- Brief README explaining the day's project
- Key learning points
- Technologies used

## 🛠️ Technology Stack
### Primary Focus:
- Rust & WebAssembly
- C Programming
- Assembly Language
- Flutter & Dart

### Additional Explorations:
- Various programming languages and frameworks
- Different programming paradigms
- System design concepts
- Algorithm implementations
- Tool development

## 🎓 Learning Approach
