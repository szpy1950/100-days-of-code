## 100 Days of Code Challenge

## 🎯 Purpose
This repository documents my journey through the #100DaysOfCode challenge, where I commit to coding daily. The goal is to maintain consistent practice while exploring various technologies, languages, and concepts. Each day represents a new learning opportunity, whether it's a complex project or a simple script.

## 🚀 Focus Areas
- Systems Programming (Rust, C)
- Web Assembly (Rust + WASM)
- Low-level Programming (Assembly)
- Cross-platform Mobile Development (Flutter/Dart)
- Various other languages and technologies as exploration opportunities

## 💡 Project and Directory Structure
